        <h1>The Perfect Trip</h1>
        
        <p>The perfect trip would be all around the world! First, I'd go through all the states of os the U.S., taking in every corner of our 'beautiful' country. <br> I want to go line dancing and mechanical bullriding in Texas, try every cheese in Wisconsin, Go skiing in Alaska, Go to the Jersey Shore and elope with an Italian American Mama ðŸ¤‘, clubbing in Miami, stay in the mountains in California, you know, <strong>the works.</strong><br> 
        <p>Of course when I get to Hawaii I'll stay there for a while, I mean who are we kidding, it's Hawaii!</p>
        


        <p>Things I'll do on that <em>heavenly</em> island:</p><br>

        <ul>
            <li>tan and swim on those gorgeous beaches</li>
            <li>explore the volcanoes(hopefully an active one)</li>
            <li>shop and get fresh ingredients to make my own food</li>
            <li>put hibiscus flowers in my hair</li>
        </ul>

        
        <p>And eat food like...</p>
